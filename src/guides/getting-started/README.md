## Getting started

This guide aims to help you with trying out Unikube for yourself and creating your first local cluster setup for a Kubernetes based project.

  
In order to make testing and trying easier for you, we provide an example application ([buzzword counter](https://github.com/Blueshoe/buzzword-charts/)) along the way but you can also try to set up your own application of course.

If you want, you can use these test credentials (without creating your own account) to try out the CLI first:
> ```
> User: sandbox@unikube.io Password: #4kEMU8aPm
> ```
