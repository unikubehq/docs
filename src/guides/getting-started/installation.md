## Linux

For Linux, we recommend installing the Unikube CLI via pip.

### 1. Install pip

If you haven't already set up pip, please follow their [installation instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#supported-methods).

### 2. Install Unikube CLI

```shell
pip install unikube
```

To install the latest pre-release use the `--pre` flag:

```shell
pip install --upgrade unikube --pre
```

The Unikube cli is developed for and tested with Python 3.8 and 3.9.

::: details Note
Python 2 is not supported. Therefore, depending on your local python installation, you may need to use `pip3`.
