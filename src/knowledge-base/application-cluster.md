## Application Cluster

An application cluster is the **strategy of using software to control multiple servers.** This clustering software then creates a connection between the servers through which they can perform various tasks such as [load balancing](./load-balancing.md), detecting node failures and assigning failover tasks.

The group of servers that has been converted into a cluster then behaves as its **own single system.** Each server manages the same information and administrative tasks. The clustering software acts as the control unit of the whole.

**Advantages of the Application Cluster:**

-   High system scalability
    
-   Easy setup of hardware components
    
-   Simple assignment of failover tasks
    
-   Delegation of transaction processing
    
-   Failover security

Unlike hardware clustering, servers can be easily added to or removed from a cluster as needed. Since no special hardware needs to be purchased for configuration, the method is also very **easy and cost-effective to implement.**
