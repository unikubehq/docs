## Cloud Hosting


Cloud hosting means that **hosting services are provided on the basis of a virtual cloud infrastructure.** The infrastructure includes administration, network, storage and servers. Different, interconnected computers, which can be located in different places, jointly provide the required computing power for cloud hosting. This power can be flexibly adapted to the hosting user's needs.

In contrast to hardware and server hosting, cloud hosting stands for **higher scalability and more security** (keyword: cloud backup).  

Further **advantages of cloud hosting are:**

 - Maximum accessibility with high performance without downtimes 
 - No failure of individual servers due to hardware damage 
 - High data integrity through distribution across different networks 
 - Hardware specialisation is possible  
 - Optimisation of individual cloud servers for a specific service 
 - Flexibility in the event of spontaneous increases in resource consumption 
 - Payment based on actual computing capacity used
