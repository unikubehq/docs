# Cloud Native Development

Cloud Native Development describes one of the most significant paradigm shifts within software development in decades. **Applications are developed directly for operation in the cloud (private, public or hybrid)** in order to create scalable and stable software products whose maintenance, expansion and operation are many times easier than in non-cloud environments.

Typically, cloud applications are **mostly developed as [microservices](./microservices.md).** In other words, applications are encapsulated in independent sub-services that communicate with one another, but can be developed separately from one another.

This approach is intended to massively **increase the speed** of innovation in IT teams.

Other tools and services that often play a role in connection with Cloud Native Development are:
-   [Docker](./docker.md)
-   [Kubernetes](./kubernetes.md)
