# Containerization

In software and web development, containerization means that **applications are packaged in a single package (container)** in such a way that the application can run independently and reliably on any infrastructure. This means that all dependencies and all the code for the application run in the aforementioned standardized container.

With containerization, software developers can develop applications **faster and more stable**, since the complexity of porting the application between different infrastructures (e.g. from local to a VM) is practically eliminated.
  
Even if the concept of process isolation and containerization is not new, it was above all the **rise of the Docker Engine** that ensured that containerization has established itself across the board in software development.
