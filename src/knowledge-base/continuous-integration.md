# Continuous Integration

A continuous integration process enables various developers that are working on code individually to migrate new code into a single piece of software. This process helps to **integrate code far more frequently** into projects and therefore handle improvements, new features and bug fixes a lot faster than it used to be possible.

Changes to the code are merged into a **central repository.** To make this work, the use of a version control system, such as github, is essential. It is best practice that newly merged code is automatically tested for various **potential break points** to ensure that the **code quality** stays consistent within the project.

Often mentioned in connection with continuous integration is the process of **continuous delivery**.
