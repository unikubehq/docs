# Docker

Docker containers are **standardized software units.** These units consist of everything that is relevant for the respective application. These can be **libraries, code and system tools.** Thanks to the practical container, software applications can be provided in any environment - whether on-site infrastructure or in the cloud.

The technology behind **Docker is based on microservices.** With these microservices, software applications can be created, scaled and tested faster and more cost-effectively. Code can be integrated and deployed faster.

The **advantages of Docker** are:

-   Microservices: Build and scale applications faster.

-   Code: Fast integration and deployment.

-   Administration: Content and infrastructure can be better controlled.
    
-   Modularity: Repairs and updates are easier to do.
    
-   Container images: Reusability of the images ensures faster development.
    
-   Rollback function: Agile development thanks to versioning.
    
-   Cost efficiency: New hardware can be put into operation much more cheaply.
