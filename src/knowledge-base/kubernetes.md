# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is responsible for the orchestration of containers in software development. Kubernetes can be used to manage the running of containers. The best known container technology comes from Docker. 

Kubernetes, also called K8s, is an open source system that consists entirely of automated processes. With the help of Kubernetes, software applications can be deployed and scaled much faster. In addition, Kubernetes helps with the administration and testing of applications.

The Kubernetes architecture is based on containers, clusters, pods and nodes. 

 - Containers contain applications and software environment.  
 - Pods gather all containers relevant to an application and run on nodes.
 - Nodes are virtual or real machines. 
 - Clusters are nodes that belong together.

Kubernetes is a system that grows with the user, which means a lot of flexibility for developers. It can be used anywhere - even on your laptop at home. With Kubernetes, microservices, among other things, can be managed much more efficiently. The decisive advantage of Kubernetes is that software applications are provided automatically.
