# Microservices

Microservices describe an approach to application development in which the **components of an application are separated into individual modules** that can be developed, deployed and also scaled independently of one another.

The use of microservices **increases flexibility** in application development, as modern container technologies such as Docker enable different technologies to be used for individual microservices.

An application typically consists of several different microservices that **communicate with each other via interfaces** such as REST.

Other technologies related to microservices:
-   [Docker](./docker.md)
-   [Kubernetes](./kubernetes.md)
