# Open Projects

**Summary**

Currently it is necessary to create an account on the Unikube platform
to work with the Unikube CLI. This feature aims to provide read-only open access.
The goal is to provide better access to work with Unikube, especially for
projects which are already open sourced.

**Impacted Services**
- Project Service: Provide GraphQL queries and unrestricted access for certain
  projects.
- Unikube frontend: Display open projects with all relevant information.
- Unikube CLI: offline / no-account mode
- Gateway - allow requests without authentication for unrestricted projects
