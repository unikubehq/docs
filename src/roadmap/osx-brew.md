# Mac OS Installation via homebrew

**Summary**  
It should be possible to install the Unikube CLI with `brew`.

**Impacted Services**  
None

The Unikube CLI is implemented in Python. Not every developer, using OSX, has the right Python
setup available to use the Unikube CLI. To make the installation process a bit more simple the CLI 
should be installable via brew.
